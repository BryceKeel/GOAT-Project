        <h2 style="color: orange;">GOAT of Celebrities</h2>
        <p>I believe that Robin Williams is the greatest</p>
        <p>celebrity of all time because he was simply kind.</p>
        <p>There are numerous stories of him having incredible</p>
        <p>relationships with the people around him, and even</p>
        <p>forced the studios he worked with to hire homeless</p> 
        <p>people as extras for any movie he was in.</p>
        <h2 style="position: absolute;top: 50pt; position: absolute;right: 200pt; color: orange;" >Charity Work</h2>
        <p style="position:absolute;top: 80pt; position: absolute;right: 70pt;">Williams was a member of the board for <a class="robin" href="https://www.christopherreeve.org" target="_blank">The Christopher Reeve Foundation</a></p>
        <p style="position:absolute;top: 100pt; position: absolute;right: 100pt;">and even founded his own charity called The Windfall Foundation.</p>
